# first_project : This is my first web app

I developped this web application 4 years ago, when I started to learn programming.
This application was dedicated to an association which helps hearing impaired and blind children, especially with medicine leaflets.

The main goal of this app is to create "online" leaflets, by completing a form with different inputs. This form can be find in `creernotice.php` php page.

I used **HTML/CSS** for the Frontend part, with **Bootstrap** framework which helps to have a better design.

I used **Php** and **SQL** for the Backend part and communication with database. I also used a Php project which generate a QrCode for each leaflet's pages. 

This project can have a lot of improvements, especally the *Preview* part which is actually made in Php. This takes too much time to display all the files that have been loaded.

I really enjoyed this project, since it was my first experience with Php and my best way to learn this language.
